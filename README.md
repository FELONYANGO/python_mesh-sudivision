# python_mesh-sudivision
 you should install both matplotlib and  and numpy and as well crearted your own virtual environment on my case i used **temp** as my environment name</br>
the **mesh.py** : crates a cube surface and use Axes3D module from Matplotlib to create a 3D plot, and then plots the vertices and edges of the cube using scatter and plot functions, respectively</br>
mesh_subdivision.py: performs the subdivision and creates a smoother surface by get the avarage at the end .it further maps it to the subdivided_mesh.obj which used by the **run.py** as my main file</br>
